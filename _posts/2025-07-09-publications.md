## AI That Learns Without Borders

Decentralized approaches to AI make it easier for scientists to share data, protect sensitive data, and develop tools that reflect the diversity of patients.

In a pathologist's office, local clinicians and researchers are working hand-in-hand to build artificial intelligence that learns locallyâ€”but can be applied globally. Instead of pooling sensitive patient data across borders, this model allows machine learning to happen within each clinic, preserving data privacy while enabling inclusive, diverse training across regions.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### ðŸ”¬ Why it matters
- Protects **patient privacy** by keeping data within hospitals and clinics.
- **Improves AI fairness** by including genetic, demographic, and clinical diversity from around the world.
- **Enables scalability**â€”each location contributes to improving the shared model, without needing centralized data storage.

- If you're building AI tools in medicine, consider **federated learning** or decentralized modelsâ€”effective for privacy and fairness.
- Clinicians and researchers: collaborate with international partners and share model updates, not sensitive data.
- Learn more about how decentralized AI is helping improve diagnostics and patient care worldwide.
