## About Us

The Division of Computational Pathology at Indiana University is dedicated to transforming diagnostics through innovation in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Our mission is to bridge the gap between pathology and computation to improve patient care, accelerate research, and foster collaboration.
This Website serves as a central hub for updates, research highlights, publications, and collaborative projects within the division. Built with Jekyll and powered by Github Pages, it enables fast, secure, and efficient communication of our latest work.
